Context layer is integration repository that helps fetch data from different providers. This is used by `Workflows` and `Tools` to have realtime information for their operations. The info falls under two categories: 
1. Onchain: Protocol Specific info, Account Specific Info from providers like Defillama, DeBank, Kaito. 
2. Offchain: This would be from social platforms like Twitter, Telegram, Discord, Coingecko.
